## Sprites

See each image file for information about their author/ripper.

All sprites were downloaded from https://www.spriters-resource.com and https://www.textures-resource.com.

The images must be valid Windows Bitmaps with 24bpp, with the sprite size as
configured in inc/global.h.

Each image must be accompanied by a text file with the exact following format:

```
number of columns
number of rows
number of pixels between columns
number of pixels between rows
right padding in pixels
bottom padding in pixels
1 or 0 indicating if a color should be made transparent
color to be made transparent or ignored
```
