- Design some better levels: replicate E1M1 for testing purposes

- Tweak enemy and movement speed, enemy hit power, accuracy, and other things by comparison to wolf3d (replicate E1M1): currently game is very hard

- Sound effects

- Music

- finish game UI
  - options
    - screen size - a few window sizes plus fullscreen
      - add background if fullscreen size does not respect hardcoded ratio of 2:1

- Add more data to level pack(s): like text to be shown between missions and what background music should play
  - Add transition effects

- Allow enemies to open doors
  - Noise crossing walls/doors to alert enemies on other side

- Put soldiers on alert based on proximity to another alert soldier, or to another enemy shooting
