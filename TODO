- Map design is becoming too complex:
  - Improve map editor and stop supporting manual editing
  - Individual buttons instead of dropdown
  - Allow editing map editor resolution
  - Add multiple views to map editor: walls/doors, placement of soldiers/objects/player/keys
- Allow saving and loading ongoing levels
- Configurable viewport (not ratio)
- Blitting
  - Size depending only on distance to center of image
  - Passable or impassable
- Show (revealed) level map
- Enemies
  - Moving projectiles
- Game UI
- Different door types
  - Door keys

Known Bugs
- Camera is able to get too close against corners of blocks.
