- Improved texture mapping: currently only part of it is flexible
- Enemies
  - strategic state (waiting, looking for player/alerted)
    - in waiting do nothing
    - in alerted keep track of where last saw player or heard noise
      - shortest path algorithm to that location (do not recalculate every frame or without the location having changed)
        - if within a number of steps and in range of fire (without other enemies in middle), shoot
        - otherwise move closer
  - detailed state (standing still, moving, shooting)
  - actions/animations
  - shooting
- Game UI
- Config file or UI menu for mouse sensitivity, resolution, FPS
  - Configurable viewport (not ratio)

---

- Allow saving and loading ongoing levels
- Music and sound effects
- Enemy noise and awareness
