When enemies get two close by mistake they can overlap the player, leaving the player stuck

When multiple objects are too close, they may obscure parts of each other in raytracing even though transparent
    Only noticed for enemies on top of enemy corpses, with the corpse being clipped
    Note enemies and corpses are blitted but still "enemies", not "objects"

Ray tracing of dead enemies next to walls/doors may clip them
