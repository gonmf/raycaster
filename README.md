# Ray casting experiment

I've been meaning to write my own 3D graphics engine from scratch, so here it is. It has texture mapping, collision detection, vertical camera movement, animation, etc.
Some notable omissions for now are floor/ceiling texture mapping and altitude.

As a demo I've rendered something akin to the first Wolfenstein game.

Since direct frame buffer access is not possible anymore, it uses SDL for pixel writing, which also makes it effortlessly cross-platform. See branch `sfml` for the original implementation of the game that used CSFML (the C-binding of SFML).

## Installation

This game uses SDL 2.0 for the graphics. You can find the installation instructions [here](http://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation).

Remember to install SDL version 2.0, that is Debian package `libsdl2-dev` or brew formula `sdl2` for instance.

Then compile by running `make` at the root directory. To play execute `./raycaster`.

The game settings are saved in file `local.options`.

### Caveats

On macOS, your cursor may behave erratically, or appear on screen (it should be hidden).

If that's case, try granting the program [accessibility permissions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5512054/147831850-8b8f304f-3615-473e-86c4-ed659e9a21a2.png).
