# Ray casting experiment

I've been meaning to write my own 3D graphics engine from scratch, so here it is. It has texture mapping, collision detection, vertical camera movement, animation, etc.
Some notable omissions for now are floor/ceiling texture mapping and altitude.

As a demo I've rendered something akin to the first Wolfenstein game.

By default the game runs with graphics capped at 120FPS, game logic at 125 updates/sec.

The game resolution is locked at 2:1, by default 800x400 upscaled, with sprites 8x8 to 64x64 pixels in size.

Since direct frame buffer access is not possible anymore, it uses SDL for pixel writing.

## Installation

This game uses SDL 2.0 for graphics and sound. First install the development package for your platform.

See how in http://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation

Then compile by running `make` at the root directory. To play execute `./raycaster`.

The game settings are saved in file `local.options`.
