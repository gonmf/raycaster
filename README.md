# Ray casting experiment

I've been meaning to write my own 3D graphics engine from scratch, so here it is. It has texture mapping, collision detection, vertical camera movement, animation, etc.
Some notable omissions for now are floor/ceiling texture mapping and altitude.

As a demo I've rendered something akin to the first Wolfenstein game.

Since direct frame buffer access is not possible anymore, I've used CSFML.

CSFML (the C binding of SFML) is not well documented, so reading the source
code is the best alternative: https://26.customprotocol.com/csfml/files.htm

## Installation

### Linux

Install package `libcsfml-dev`.

Compile by running `make`.

### MacOS

First install `homebrew`, and then package `csfml` and the C compiler of your choice.

Compile by running `make`.
